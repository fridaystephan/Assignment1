    <!--This is Question number 2-->
    <p align="justify">This is the very webpage that I designed after three weeks of training on Capacity Bay. The tutors, called faculties, have been very helpful. The truth is that I never knew that coding could be this easy. However, from the classes so far I have learned that the secret to coding is understanding the basics. It is like trying to build a house, the first thing is to survey the land and then draw up the architectural design of the house which forms the blueprint for the house. Similarly, in coding, the first thing is to understand the basic formatting tools and commands. Having a deep understanding of these tools can help one become a professional coder. Thanks to Capacity Bay, it has been a smooth journey so far. Some of the things that I have learned from the classes include but are not limited to creating a GitHub account, the configuration of Gitbash, creating a Github repository, Creating Html documents, and the various Html formatting tools. What intrigues me most about the classes is the patience of the instructors. They take their time to explain simple concepts over and over again. Also, the faculties are very patient and they take their time to correct without condeming the students in class. I look forward to becoming to learning more things from the Capacity Bay classes!</p>

    <!--This is Question number 9-->
    <p align="justify"> <b>HTML is the language in which most websites are written</b>. <strong>HTML is used to create pages and make them functional</strong>. HTML was first created by <i>Tim Berners-Lee</i>, <i>Robert Cailliau</i>, and others starting in <i>1989</i>. It stands for <mark>Hyper Text Markup Language</mark>. <em>Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether</em>. The latest version is known as <mark color="blue">HTML5</mark>. A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: <ins>tags and attributes</ins>. Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML. They work together but perform different functions. Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: <del><'h1'></del>. Most tags must be opened <'h1'> and closed <'/h1'> in order to function. On the other hand, Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside. An example of an attribute is: <'img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">. In this instance, the image source <sup>(src)</sup> and the alt text <sub>(alt)</sub> are attributes of the <'img'> tag. In addition, the vast majority of tags must be opened (<'tag'>) and closed (<'/tag'>) with the element information such as a title or text resting between the tags. Also, when using multiple tags, the tags must be closed in the order in which they were opened. For example: '<'strong'><'em'>This is really important!<'/em'><'/strong'>'' </p>
